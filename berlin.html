				<p>My initial response was to look for  a problem within a sector that could change the world. An area that is held back by the status quo and is ripe for change. I identified 3 key areas of potential:</p>

					<h4>WHY SCIENCE</h4>
					<h2>Science is the key to our future.</h2>
	      </div>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>It made sense to me that one of the most important factors affecting our future is our rate of scientific advancement. It's also a subject that has been close to my heart since I was a little boy. I have very little knowledge of what a problem could be within the science community, however I hypothesised that since science is essentially about the creation, flow and discussion of data then the easiest way to improve science would be to improve how scientists can work. I initially saw 4 areas wear I may be able to investigate for a problem:</p>

					<h4>INTERVIEWS</h4>
					<h2>Finding real problems faced by real scientists.</h2>
	      </div>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>I began by interviewing 10 researchers at a variety of universities within the UK who were completing PhDs in a variety of scientific fields. These initial interviews were completely explorative. I just wanted to 'get a feel' for science and their day to day lives.<br><br>I very quickly began to highlight problems that I believe they didn't even fully acknowledge as problems. When asked why the problem existed I was told, "this is just how science is mate...". This problem was centered around the publishing of their research.<br><br>By the 10th interview I had a strong feeling that I had found my problem.</p>

				<div class="topic-head">
					<h4>PROBLEM FOUND</h4>
					<h2>Publishing is centralised, biased and unfair.</h2>
	      </div>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Within the science community ones career can be made or broken by the quality of publishings they get. A quality publish will lead to higher levels of trust from the community. Trust within this community means trust in the scientists professional capability, reliability, impact factor and trust that their results are accurate and untampered. A quality publish can cost thousands. Which alienates a large portion of the scientific community from poorer economies, poorer institutions and amateur researchers.</p>

          <li>Pressure to publish takes precedence over quality of publishing.</li>

            <li>Concept is decentralised, transparent and community driven.</li>
            <li>Quality of publishing becomes more important than just publishing as the better a piece of work is regarded by the community, the higher the reward to the author(s).</li>
            <li>Failures and null hypothesis help other scientists and can still result in author being further rewarded after publishing.</li>
            <li>Slight taxing of mining means that a fund can be created to advance research.</li>
